## Study Guide Programs

To practice writing program specifications and apply what we've learned I came up with two programs for myself to build.

### Program One - User Created Dictionary

[Code](study_guide_pp1.py)

- Write a program that asks a user to input words, end the program when they press `<Enter>`.
- Add each word to a dictionary where the `key` is the first letter in the word and the value is a list of words starting with that letter.
- Output the dictionary that was created to a new file `dictionary.txt` to look like:

	```
	A
	Alacritty, Alone 
	C
	Coding
	G
	Guitarist
	P	
	Parasite, Pedantic
	
### Program Two - Word Search Engine

[Code](study_guide_pp2.py)


- Write a program that takes the output file from the first program.
- Prompt the user for a single letter and return the words belonging to that letter.
- Exit the program if the user types `<Enter>`.
