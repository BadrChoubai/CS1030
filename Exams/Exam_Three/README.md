# CS 1030 Exam Three

## Problem One

Create a program that reads the name of a month from the user as a string. Your program should display the number of days in that month. For February, display “28 or 29 days” to allow for leap years. You must use lists or tuples (and not dictionaries) to hold the names of the months and the number of days in months.

## Problem Two

Read from a user a list of words, one word at a time until the user presses just the `<Enter>` key. Your program will output a word or words with commas inserted at the common positions in a list of words. For example:

```bash
Apples
Apples and oranges
Apples, oranges and bananas
Apples, oranges, bananas and kumquats
```

Your program will be able to process any number of words starting with one word. (The user won’t press just the `<Enter>` key when the program starts.)

## Problem Three

Using a dictionary, create a program that determines and displays the number of unique characters in a string entered by a user, and the number of times each unique character appears.

 For example, the string: "Hello, World!"     yields a count of 10 unique characters and a dictionary output of `{ ‘H’ : 1, ‘e’ : 1, ‘l’ : 3, etc. }`. The order of the output does not matter. A string of "zzzz" yields a count of 1 and a dictionary output of `{ ‘z’ : 4 }`.
