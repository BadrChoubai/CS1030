### Description ###

This is my solution for problem two of three of Python Project One

The Problem:

    Convert from miles per gallon to liters per kilomete
    
    2.1 Prompt the user to enter a figure for miles per gallon.

    2.2 If the amount is <= 0, exit the program.

    2.3 Convert miles to kilometers and gallons to liters. (Google the formulas.)

    2.4 From the previous step, calculate liters per kilometer.

    2.5 Print the miles per gallon and liters per kilometer with relevant messages, formatting your results to one decimal place.

    2.6 Exit the program.
