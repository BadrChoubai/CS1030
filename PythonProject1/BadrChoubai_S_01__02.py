### Description ###

This is my solution for problem two of three of Python Project One

The Problem:

    Add a loop to the first problem's program. 

    2.1 Create the new Python file by copying the file created in Exercise 1.

    2.2 Change the program to add a loop to continuously ask the user for a height to convert to meters. If the user enters an empty string (i.e., presses just the <Enter> key) exit the program.
