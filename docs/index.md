## Welcome

If there's anything you're struggling to learn or are curious about, reach out to Professor Kramer in class or at his office hours.

I'd also like to offer my free time to help you learn so don't hesitate to ask me questions.

## Resources 

### Python

- [Corey Schafer](https://www.youtube.com/user/schafer5/featured) - Corey Schafer's YouTube channel was one of the first channels I found when starting to learn Python. He has videos on other topics such as Data Visualization and Building a full stack application in Django (think, Ruby on Rails).
