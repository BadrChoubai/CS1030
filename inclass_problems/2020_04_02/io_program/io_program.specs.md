# IO Program Specifications

During today's class the professor asked students to come up with a specification for their own file IO programs. I came up with a simple one that takes a list of students names and outputs them to another file alphabetically.

## The Problem

Write a program that takes an input file containing a list of student names in an unsorted manner. The program should output the same list, alphabetically sorted to an ouput file.

### Specifications

1. Open the file containing the student names and read it line by line.
2. Store the contents in a list
3. If needed, clean the lines.
    - Watch out for special characters and format characters
4. Sort the list of names 
5. Output the new sorted list of names to the output file.
